	Abstract = {UNLABELLED: Competition between microbes is widespread in nature, especially among those that are closely related. To combat competitors, bacteria have evolved numerous protein-based systems (bacteriocins) that kill strains closely related to the producer. In characterizing the bacteriocin complement and killing spectra for the model strain Pseudomonas syringae B728a, we discovered that its activity was not linked to any predicted bacteriocin but is derived from a prophage. Instead of encoding an active prophage, this region encodes a bacteriophage-derived bacteriocin, termed an R-type syringacin. This R-type syringacin is striking in its convergence with the well-studied R-type pyocin of P. aeruginosa in both genomic location and molecular function. Genomic alignment, amino acid percent sequence identity, and phylogenetic inference all support a scenario where the R-type syringacin has been co-opted independently of the R-type pyocin. Moreover, the presence of this region is conserved among several other Pseudomonas species and thus is likely important for intermicrobial interactions throughout this important genus.
IMPORTANCE: Evolutionary innovation is often achieved through modification of complexes or processes for alternate purposes, termed co-option. Notable examples include the co-option of a structure functioning in locomotion (bacterial flagellum) to one functioning in protein secretion (type three secretion system). Similar co-options can occur independently in distinct lineages. We discovered a genomic region in the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae that consists of a fragment of a bacteriophage genome. The fragment encodes only the tail of the bacteriophage, which is lethal toward strains of this species. This structure is similar to a previously described structure produced by the related species Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The two structures, however, are not derived from the same evolutionary event. Thus, they represent independent bacteriophage co-options. The co-opted bacteriophage from P. syringae is found in the genomes of many other Pseudomonas species, suggesting ecological importance across this genus.},

@article{Kandel20a,
	Abstract = {Phage tail-like bacteriocins (tailocins) are bacterially-produced protein toxins that mediate competitive interactions between co-colonizing bacteria. Both theoretical and experimental research has shown there are intransitive interactions between bacteriocin-producing, bacteriocin-sensitive, and bacteriocin-resistant populations, whereby producers outcompete sensitive, sensitive outcompete resistant, and resistant outcompete producers. These so-called rock-paper-scissor dynamics explain how all three populations occupy the same environment, without one driving the others extinct. Using Pseudomonas syringae as a model, we demonstrate that otherwise sensitive cells survive bacteriocin exposure through a physiological mechanism. This mechanism allows cells to survive bacteriocin without acquiring resistance. We show that a significant fraction of the target cells that survive a lethal dose of tailocin did not exhibit any detectable increase in survival in subsequent exposure. Tailocin persister cells were more prevalent in stationary rather than log phase cultures. Of the fraction of cells that gained detectable resistance, there was a range from complete (insensitive) to incomplete (partially sensitive). By genomic sequencing and genetic engineering we showed that a mutation in a hypothetical gene containing 8-10 transmembrane domains causes tailocin high-persistence and genes of various glycosyl transferases cause incomplete and complete tailocin resistance. Importantly, of the several classes of mutations, only those causing complete tailocin resistance compromised host fitness. This result, indicates that bacteria likely utilize persistence to survive bacteriocin-mediated killing without suffering the costs associated with resistance. This research provides important insight into how bacteria can escape the trap of fitness trade-offs associated with gaining de novo tailocin resistance.Importance Bacteriocins are bacterially produced protein toxins that are proposed as antibiotics alternatives. However, a deeper understanding of the responses of target bacteria to bacteriocin exposure is lacking. Here, we show that target cells of Pseudomonas syringae survive lethal bacteriocin exposure through both physiological persistence and genetic resistance mechanisms. Cells that are not growing rapidly rely primarily on persistence, whereas those growing rapidly are more likely to survive via resistance. We identified various mutations in lipopolysaccharide biogenesis related regions involved in tailocin persistence and resistance. By assessing host fitness of various classes of mutants, we showed that persistence and subtle resistance are mechanisms to survive competition and preserve host fitness. These results have important implications in developing bacteriocins as alternative therapeutic agents.},

@article{Baltrus11a,
	Abstract = {Closely related pathogens may differ dramatically in host range, but the molecular, genetic, and evolutionary basis for these differences remains unclear. In many Gram- negative bacteria, including the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae, type III effectors (TTEs) are essential for pathogenicity, instrumental in structuring host range, and exhibit wide diversity between strains. To capture the dynamic nature of virulence gene repertoires across P. syringae, we screened 11 diverse strains for novel TTE families and coupled this nearly saturating screen with the sequencing and assembly of 14 phylogenetically diverse isolates from a broad collection of diseased host plants. TTE repertoires vary dramatically in size and content across all P. syringae clades; surprisingly few TTEs are conserved and present in all strains. Those that are likely provide basal requirements for pathogenicity. We demonstrate that functional divergence within one conserved locus, hopM1, leads to dramatic differences in pathogenicity, and we demonstrate that phylogenetics-informed mutagenesis can be used to identify functionally critical residues of TTEs. The dynamism of the TTE repertoire is mirrored by diversity in pathways affecting the synthesis of secreted phytotoxins, highlighting the likely role of both types of virulence factors in determination of host range. We used these 14 draft genome sequences, plus five additional genome sequences previously reported, to identify the core genome for P. syringae and we compared this core to that of two closely related non-pathogenic pseudomonad species. These data revealed the recent acquisition of a 1 Mb megaplasmid by a sub-clade of cucumber pathogens. This megaplasmid encodes a type IV secretion system and a diverse set of unknown proteins, which dramatically increases both the genomic content of these strains and the pan-genome of the species.},

@article{Vetsigian11a,
	Abstract = {Soil grains harbor an astonishing diversity of Streptomyces strains producing diverse secondary metabolites. However, it is not understood how this genotypic and chemical diversity is ecologically maintained. While secondary metabolites are known to mediate signaling and warfare among strains, no systematic measurement of the resulting interaction networks has been available. We developed a high-throughput platform to measure all pairwise interactions among 64 Streptomyces strains isolated from several individual grains of soil. We acquired more than 10,000 time-lapse movies of colony development of each isolate on media containing compounds produced by each of the other isolates. We observed a rich set of such sender-receiver interactions, including inhibition and promotion of growth and aerial mycelium formation. The probability that two random isolates interact is balanced; it is neither close to zero nor one. The interactions are not random: the distribution of the number of interactions per sender is bimodal and there is enrichment for reciprocity--if strain A inhibits or promotes B, it is likely that B also inhibits or promotes A. Such reciprocity is further enriched in strains derived from the same soil grain, suggesting that it may be a property of coexisting communities. Interactions appear to evolve rapidly: isolates with identical 16S rRNA sequences can have very different interaction patterns. A simple eco-evolutionary model of bacteria interacting through antibiotic production shows how fast evolution of production and resistance can lead to the observed statistical properties of the network. In the model, communities are evolutionarily unstable--they are constantly being invaded by strains with new sets of interactions. This combination of experimental and theoretical observations suggests that diverse Streptomyces communities do not represent a stable ecological state but an intrinsically dynamic eco-evolutionary phenomenon.},

@article{Vasi94a,
	Abstract = {Twelve populations of the bacterium Escherichia coli were propagated for 2,000 generations in a seasonal environment, which consisted of alternating periods of feast and famine. The mean fitness of the derived genotypes increased by \&{\#}x223c;35{\%} relative to their common ancestor, based on competition experiments in the same environment. The bacteria could have adapted, in principle, by decreasing their lag prior to growth upon transfer to fresh medium (L), increasing their maximum growth rate (Vm), reducing the concentration of resource required to support growth at half the maximum rate (Ks), and reducing their death rate after the limiting resource was exhausted (D). We estimated these parameters for the ancestor and then calculated the opportunity for selection on each parameter. The inferred selection gradients for Vm and L were much steeper than for Ks and D. The derived genotypes showed significant improvement in Vm and L but not in Ks or D. Also, the numerical yield in pure culture of the derived genotypes was significantly lower than the yield of the common ancestor, but the average cell size was much larger. The independently derived genotypes are somewhat more variable in these life-history traits than in their relative fitnesses, which indicates that they acquired different genetic adaptations to the seasonal environment. Nonetheless, the evolutionary changes in life-history traits exhibit substantial parallelism among the replicate populations.},

@article{Dulla10a,
	Abstract = {Leaf surfaces harbour bacterial epiphytes that are capable of influencing the quorum sensing (QS) system, density determination through detection of diffusible signal molecules, of the plant-pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Pss) which controls expression of extracellular polysaccharide production, motility and other factors contributing to virulence to plants. Approximately 11% of the bacterial epiphytes recovered from a variety of plants produced a diffusible factor capable of inhibiting the QS system of Pss as indicated by suppression of ahlI. Blockage of QS by these interfering strains correlated strongly with their ability to limit iron availability to Pss. A direct relationship between the ability of isogenic Escherichia coli strains to sequester iron via their production of different siderophores and their ability to suppress QS in Pss was also observed. Quorum sensing induction was inversely related to iron availability in culture media supplemented with iron chelators or with FeCl(3). Co-inoculation of interfering strains with Pss onto leaves increased the number of resultant disease lesions over twofold compared with that on plants inoculated with Pss alone. Transposon-generated mutants of interfering strains in which QS inhibition was blocked did not increase disease when co-inoculated with Pss. Increased disease incidence was also not observed when a non-motile mutant of Pss was co-inoculated onto plants with QS interfering bacteria suggesting that these strains enhanced the motility of Pss in an iron-dependent manner, leading to an apparent increase in virulence of this pathogen. Considerable cross-talk mediated by iron scavenging apparently occurs on plants, thereby altering the behaviour of bacteria such as Pss that exhibit important QS-dependent traits in this habitat.},

	Abstract = {The leaf surface harbors a host of bacterial epiphytes that are capable of influencing the quorum sensing (QS) system of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Pss). Pss uses QS to regulate expression of genes conferring extracellular polysaccharide production, motility and factors contributing to virulence to plants. About 7% of bacterial epiphytes isolated in this study produce the Pss cognate signal, 3-oxohexanoyl-homoserine lactone (3OC6HSL), often in amounts more than 10-fold higher than Pss. Premature induction of QS in Pss by these 3OC6HSL-producing epiphytes suppressed swarming motility and subsequent disease of the leaf. Co-inoculation of 3OC6HSL-producing strains with Pss reduced the number of lesions when inoculated together onto leaves compared with that of plants inoculated with Pss alone. Strains in which 3OC6HSL accumulation was quenched by expression of an N-acyl-homoserine lactonase did not decrease disease when co-inoculated with Pss. Disease incidence caused by a nonmotile mutant of Pss was not affected by 3OC6HSL-producing bacteria, suggesting that exogenous 3OC6HSL signal that altered the motility of Pss was responsible for reducing the apparent virulence of this pathogen. Thus, considerable cross talk involving exogenous 3OC6HSL occurs on leaves and this process can be exploited for disease control.},

@article{Quinones05a,
	Abstract = {The N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL)-mediated quorum-sensing system in the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae requires the AHL synthase AhlI and the regulator AhlR, and is additionally subject to regulation by AefR. The contribution of quorum sensing to the expression of a variety of traits expected to be involved in epiphytic fitness and virulence of P syringae were examined. Both an aefR- mutant and an ahlI- ahlR- double mutant, deficient in AHL production, were significantly impaired in alginate production and had an increased susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide compared with the wild-type strain. These mutants were hypermotile in culture, invaded leaves more rapidly, and caused an increased incidence of brown spot lesions on bean leaves after a 48-h moist incubation. Interestingly, an aefR- mutant was both the most motile and virulent. Like the wild-type strain, the AHL-deficient mutant strains incited water-soaked lesions on bean pods. However, lesions caused by an ahlI- ahlR- double mutant were larger, whereas those incited by an aefR- mutant were smaller. In contrast, tissue maceration of pods, which occurs at a later stage of infection, was completely abolished in the AHL-deficient mutants. Both the incidence of disease and in planta growth of P syringae pv. tabaci were greatly reduced in transgenic tobacco plants that produced AHL compared with wild-type plants. These results demonstrate that quorum sensing in E syringae regulates traits that contribute to epiphytic fitness as well as to distinct stages of disease development during plant infection.},

@article{Laird18a,
	Abstract = {Abstract Recent evidence suggests that intransitive competition (as in the game ``rock-paper-scissors,'' and in contrast to transitive or hierarchical competition) may be common in natural plant communities. This is important as theoretical analyses indicate that intransitivity promotes species coexistence. However, while intransitivity is common, competitive relationships among many species in communities may vary from transitive to highly intransitive. With increasing numbers of species, variation in competitive interrelationships among species can take on vastly more variable topologies. Consequently, several indices can be used to capture topological variation that is relevant to the prediction of species coexistence. Different indices capture different elements of topological variation. In addition, evidence indicates that these indices vary in their capacity to predict coexistence, and that variation not captured by these indices also contributes to variation in species coexistence. We used aspatial and spatial competition models to explore how well different indices (Slater's i, Kendall and Babington Smith's d, Monsuur and Storcken's ν, Bezembinder's ρ and Bezembinder's δ′, plus two binary indices we call ``unbeatability'' [u] and ``always-beatability'' [a]) predict coexistence under the full spectrum of competitive tournament topologies for three to eight species, and a large sample of existing tournament topologies for nine species. All indices explored were generally better at predicting short-term coexistence (i.e. the number of generations until the first extinction) compared to long-term coexistence (i.e. generations until monoculture or long-term species richness in aspatial and spatial models respectively). Indices also differed in performance: Kendall and Babington Smith's d (a measure of the number intransitive cycles among an assemblage's three-species subsets that has also been reformulated as the relative intransitivity index) was the best predictor of short-term coexistence; in terms of long-term coexistence, the best predictor was typically d or u, the latter indicating the presence or absence of a species capable of outcompeting all its competitors. Synthesis. The indices employed here capture different elements of topological variation. Existing indices that capture aspects of intransitive competition vary in their capacity to predict coexistence in competition models. The more continuous nature of Kendall and Babington Smith's d index likely contributed to its robust performance; likewise, the ability of unbeatability to detect intransitivities involving the strongest competitors helps explain its success.},

	Abstract = {The spatial organization of cells within bacterial aggregates on leaf surfaces was determined for pair-wise mixtures of three different bacterial species commonly found on leaves, Pseudomonas syringae, Pantoea agglomerans, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Cells were coinoculated onto bean plants and allowed to grow under moist conditions, and the resulting aggregates were examined in situ by epifluorescence microscopy. Each bacterial strain could be localized because it expressed either the green or the cyan fluorescent protein constitutively, and the viability of individual cells was assessed by propidium iodide staining. Each pair of bacterial strains that was coinoculated onto leaves formed mixed aggregates. The degree of segregation of cells in mixed aggregates differed between the different coinoculated pairs of strains and was higher in mixtures of P. fluorescens A506 and P. agglomerans 299R and mixtures of P. syringae B728a and P. agglomerans 299R than in mixtures of two isogenic strains of P. agglomerans 299R. The fractions of the total cell population that were dead in mixed and monospecific aggregates of a gfp-marked strain of P. agglomerans 299R and a cfp-marked strain of P. agglomerans 299R, or of P. fluorescens A506 and P. agglomerans 299R, were similar. However, the proportion of dead cells in mixed aggregates of P. syringae B728a and P. agglomerans 299R was significantly higher (13.2% +/- 8.2%) than that in monospecific aggregates of these two strains (1.6% +/- 0.7%), and it increased over time. While dead cells in such mixed aggregates were preferentially found at the interface between clusters of cells of these strains, cells of these two strains located at the interface did not exhibit equal probabilities of mortality. After 9 days of incubation, about 77% of the P. agglomerans 299R cells located at the interface were dead, while only about 24% of the P. syringae B728a cells were dead. The relevance of our results to understanding bacterial interactions on leaf surfaces and the implications for biological control of pathogenic and other deleterious microorganisms is discussed.},

	Abstract = {De Wit replacement series were used to study competitive interactions between epiphytic IcePseudomonas syringae strains and the biological frost control agents IceP. syringae TLP2del1 and Pseudomonas fluorescens A506. Mixtures containing two strains in different proportions but at a constant total population size were inoculated onto potato leaves. The population sizes of each strain and the total population size were determined when the community had reached equilibrium. A near-isogenic P. syringae strain pair exhibited an interaction similar to that expected for strains competing equally for limiting environmental resources. Replacement series with nonisogenic Ice and IceP. syringae strain pairs suggested that these strains competed for limiting resources according to their relative competitive abilities. There was no evidence of any niche differentiation between the IceP. syringae strains and the IceP. syringae strain. The growth responses of epiphytes following addition of nutrients to the phyllosphere indicated that the epiphytic P. syringae populations were nutrient limited and that, under growth chamber conditions, the populations were more limited by the availability of carbon than by the availability of nitrogen. Determination of in vitro carbon source utilization profiles provided further evidence for the lack of niche differentiation between the Ice and the IceP. syringae strains. Niche overlap indices calculated for the IceP. syringae strains with respect to IceP. syringae TLP2del1 were uniformly high, indicating ecological similarity, and were consistent with the observed low level of coexistence. The biological frost control agent P. fluorescens A506 replaced P. syringae. This was correlated with a high degree of niche overlap between these species.},

	Abstract = {The levels of coexistence between Pseudomonas syringae and various nonpathogenic epiphytic species in the phyllosphere of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were assessed by using replacement series. The epiphytic species Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pantoea agglomerans, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Methylobacterium organophilum were all capable of exhibiting higher levels of coexistence with P. syringae than was observed with a near-isogenic P. syringae strain pair. The ecological similarity of the epiphytes was estimated with niche overlap indices derived from in vitro carbon source utilization profiles. The level of coexistence of the epiphytes was inversely correlated with the ecological similarity of the strains. Hence, the level of coexistence between the epiphytes was proportional to the degree of niche differentiation, defined as the ability to utilize carbon sources not utilized by a competing strain. Comparisons of utilization profiles for groups of carbon sources (amino acids, organic acids, and carbohydrates) indicated the types of carbon sources for which the strains likely competed in the bean phyllosphere. P. fluorescens and P. syringae strains probably competed for most carbon sources. S. maltophilia and M. organophilum strains probably competed with P. syringae for most organic acids but few amino acids or carbohydrates. P. agglomerans strains probably competed with P. syringae for most amino acids and organic acids but few carbohydrates. A variable level of coexistence observed between P. agglomerans and P. syringae probably reflected the variability in abundance in the bean phyllosphere of the carbohydrates that P. agglomerans utilized exclusively.},

	Abstract = {The invasion and exclusion abilities of coexisting Pseudomonas syringae strains were quantified on leaves. Twenty-nine P. syringae strains were inoculated onto plants in 107 pairwise combinations. All pairs were duplicated so that each strain was inoculated both first as an antagonist strain (day 0) and second as a challenge strain (day 3). The population size of each strain in a mixture was quantified on day 6 following incubation under moist conditions. For P. syringae strains, the presence of an established population often significantly reduced the growth of subsequently arriving challenge strains on the leaf surface. Invasion and exclusion abilities, quantified by contrasting population sizes of challenge strains in the presence and in the absence of another strain, varied significantly among P. syringae strains and were partly a function of the particular strain pair. The population size of a strain when present alone on a leaf was not predictive of invasion or exclusion ability. Successful invaders were significantly less likely to exclude challenge populations than were nonsuccessful invaders. Population sizes of successful excluders were negatively correlated with population sizes of coexisting challenge strains, while population sizes of successful invaders were positively correlated with those of coexisting antagonist strains. The patterns of interaction among coexisting strains suggest mechanisms for successful invasion and exclusion among P. syringae strains on leaves.},

	Abstract = {Pseudomonas syringae is a plant pathogen well known for its capacity to grow epiphytically on diverse plants and for its ice-nucleation activity. The ensemble of its known biology and ecology led us to postulate that this bacterium is also present in non-agricultural habitats, particularly those associated with water. Here, we report the abundance of P. syringae in rain, snow, alpine streams and lakes and in wild plants, in addition to the previously reported abundance in epilithic biofilms. Each of these substrates harbored strains that corresponded to P. syringae in terms of biochemical traits, pathogenicity and pathogenicity-related factors and that were ice-nucleation active. Phylogenetic comparisons of sequences of four housekeeping genes of the non-agricultural strains with strains of P. syringae from disease epidemics confirmed their identity as P. syringae. Moreover, strains belonging to the same clonal lineage were isolated from snow, irrigation water and a diseased crop plant. Our data suggest that the different substrates harboring P. syringae modify the structure of the associated populations. Here, we propose a comprehensive life cycle for P. syringae--in agricultural and non-agricultural habitats--driven by the environmental cycle of water. This cycle opens the opportunity to evaluate the importance of non-agricultural habitats in the evolution of a plant pathogen and the emergence of virulence. The ice-nucleation activity of all strains from snow, unlike from other substrates, strongly suggests that P. syringae plays an active role in the water cycle as an ice nucleus in clouds.},

However, it is unknown how much of the coexistence we observe in nature results from this mechanism when species interactions are also stabilized by pairwise niche differences. We combined field-parameterized models of competition among 18 annual plant species with tools from network theory to quantify the prevalence of intransitive competitive relationships. We then analyzed the predicted outcome of competitive interactions with and without pairwise niche differences. Intransitive competition was found for just 15?19{\%} of the 816 possible triplets, and this mechanism was never sufficient to stabilize the coexistence of the triplet when the pair-wise niche differences between competitors were removed. Of the transitive and intransitive triplets, only four were predicted to coexist and these were more similar in multidimensional trait space defined by 11 functional traits than non-coexisting triplets. Our results argue that intransitive competition may be less frequent than recently posed, and that even when it does operate, pairwise niche differences may be key to possible coexistence.},

	N2 = {Summary 1. Plant communities are generally thought to follow strict competitive hierarchies, in which species can be linearly ordered according to their ability to compete for a few limiting resources. Such strict hierarchies should lead to reduced diversity, since the single best competitor will eventually exclude the other species. However, more complex dynamics may emerge if different plant species or genotypes compete in different ways, such as through the release of toxic allelochemicals or the alteration of soil microbial communities. 2. Brassica nigra genotypes and their competitor species show a ?rock-paper-scissors? like dynamic, in which no one type is competitively superior to all others. This intransitive dynamic can maintain both species diversity and genetic variation in an allelochemical trait of B. nigra. 3. Here we show that feedbacks with soil biota, probably involving arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, facilitate these dynamics. Brassica nigra genotypes that invest heavily in the allelochemical sinigrin reduce mycorrhizal abundance of surrounding soils, which reduces the growth of heterospecific competitors. Since B. nigra is non-mycorrhizal, investment in sinigrin does not improve a genotype?s ability to compete with other conspecifics. 4. Synthesis. These results highlight the importance of complex soil communities for the maintenance of both genetic and species diversity in plant communities.},

The prevalence of multiple morphs is a challenge to evolutionary theory because a single strategy should prevail unless morphs have exactly equal fitness4,5 or a fitness advantage when rare6,7. We report here the application of an evolutionary stable strategy model to a three-morph mating system in the side-blotched lizard. Using parameter estimates from field data, the model predicted oscillations in morph frequency, and the frequencies of the three male morphs were found to oscillate over a six-year period in the field. The fitnesses of each morph relative to other morphs were non-transitive in that each morph could invade another morph when rare, but was itself invadable by another morph when common. Concordance between frequency-dependent selection and the among-year changes in morph fitnesses suggest that male interactions drive a dynamic 'rock--paper--scissors' game7.},

Although theory predicts that these interactions may be common in assemblages of three or more competitors, experimental studies of this process are rare. Here, I report a study of a northern California riparian community, where I tested the hypothesis that the sedge Carex nudata had direct competitive effects on other plant species, as well as indirect facilitative effects, by suppressing a second competitor, the common monkey-flower Mimulus guttatus. Results of a field experiment, in which I manipulated the presence of Carex and M. guttatus in a factorial design, uncovered three qualitatively different interactions between Carex and three target species. I found evidence of indirect facilitation for the liverwort Conocephalum conicum, such that Carex ?facilitated? Conocephalum in the presence of M. guttatus, while Carex competed with Conocephalum in the absence of M. guttatus. Plant distribution patterns supported the widespread occurrence of this interaction. Carex also had an indirect positive effect on the scarlet monkey-flower M. cardinalis, though the magnitude of this effect was similar to direct Carex competition. Lastly, Carex had no influence on the moss Brachythecium frigidum. The mechanisms underlying the plant interactions in this study are discussed and incorporated into a general hypothesis that indirect facilitation among competitors is most important in assemblages of species that vary in competitive mechanism.},

In this Opinion article, we propose a definition of keystone taxa in microbial ecology and summarize over 200 microbial keystone taxa that have been identified in soil, plant and marine ecosystems, as well as in the human microbiome. We explore the importance of keystone taxa and keystone guilds for microbiome structure and functioning and discuss the factors that determine their distribution and activities.},

@article{Wootton94a,
	Abstract = {Indirect effects occur when the impact of one species on another requires the presence of a third species. They can arise in two general ways: through linked chains of direct interactions, and when a species changes the interactions among species. Indirect effects have been uncovered largely by experimental studies that have monitored the response of many species and discovered "unexpected results," although some studies have looked for specific indirect effects predicted from simple models. The characteristics of such approaches make it likely that the many indirect effects remain uncovered, but the application of techniques such as path analysis may reduce this problem. Deterministic theory indicates that indirect effects should often be important, although stochastic models need exploration. Simulation models indicate that some indirect effects may stabilize multi-species assemblages. Five simple types of indirect effects have been regularly demonstrated in nature: exploitative competition, trophic cascades, apparent competition, indirect mutualism, and interaction modifications. Detailed experimental investigations of natural communities have yielded complicated effects. Indirect effects have the potential to affect evolutionary patterns, but empirical examples are limited. Future directions in the study of indirect effects include developing techniques to estimate interaction strength in dynamic models, deriving more efficient approaches to detecting indirect effects, evaluating the effectiveness of approaches such as path analysis, and investigating mechanisms in which a species changes how other species interact.},

	Abstract = {Abstract A fundamental assumption of coexistence theory is that competition inevitably decreases species diversity. Consequently, in the quest to understand the ecological regulators of diversity, there has been a great deal of focus on processes with the potential to reduce competitive exclusion. However, the notion that competition must decrease diversity is largely based on the outcome of two-species interaction experiments and models, despite the fact that species rarely interact only in pairs in natural systems. In a field experiment, we found that competition among native perennial plants in multispecies assemblages was far weaker than competition between those same species in pairwise arrangements and that indirect interactions appeared to weaken direct competitive effects. These results suggest that community assembly theory based on pairwise approaches may overestimate the strength of competition and likelihood of competitive exclusion in species-rich communities. We also found that Centaurea stoebe , a North American invader, retained strong competitive effects when competing against North American natives in both pairwise and multispecies assemblages. Our experimental results support an emerging body of theory suggesting that complex networks of competing species may generate strong indirect interactions that can maintain diversity and that ecological differentiation may not be necessary to attenuate competition.},

	Abstract = {A measure of net interspecific competition is proposed which incorporates both direct and indirect effects between each species pair in a community. Indirect effects of one species on another may be mediated through other species in the community such that changes in the first species induce changes in other species which in turn directly affect the second species. Even in a competitive community these indirect effects are not necessarily always of a competitive nature and may sometimes actually act to oppose the effects of direct competition. Species pairs which are strong competitors in isolation may exhibit little net competition or even appear mutualistic depending on the other species present in the community. An expression for the net competitive effects between species pairs is derived in terms of the elements of the α-matrix representation of the direct competitive effects. Examples calculated from the literature suggest that indirect competitive effects may often act to counterbalance direct competition between otherwise strong competitors in natural communities.},

	Abstract = {Indirect effects occurring through chains of direct species interactions have been shown to be important in many communities. If indirect effects have strong ecological effects, then they must also have strong evolutionary effects through natural selection. We consider how indirect effects, both positive and negative, combine with positive and negative direct effects to influence evolution between interacting species. Any one species can evolve in response to direct interactions with other species by changing its ``response'' to the presence of the other species or changing its ``effect'' on the species. We argue that the direction (positive or negative) of the direct and indirect effects will determine whether traits related to ``response'' or ``effect'' are most likely to be subject to natural selection. Further, covariance patterns of species in the same community should increase when direct and indirect effects between species act in the same direction, resulting in greater compartmentalization of such communities.},

Here we show that models for intransitive competition embedding slightly different interaction rules can produce opposite patterns. In particular, we find that interactions in which an individual can be outcompeted by its neighbors, but cannot outcompete its neighbors, produce negative frequency dependence that, in turn, promotes coexistence. Whenever the interaction rule is modified toward symmetry (the individual and the neighbors can outcompete each other) the negative frequency dependence vanishes, producing different coexistence levels. Macroscopically, we find that asymmetric interactions yield highest biodiversity if species compete globally, while symmetric interactions favor highest biodiversity if competition takes place locally.},

@article{Delong13a,
	Abstract = {The potential connection between exploitation and interference competition was recognized long ago but has not been evaluated. We measured the levels of both forms of competition for the protist Didinium preying upon Paramecium. Across populations, exploitation intensity was tightly linked to interference intensity, and the form of this relationship follows from a simple model of interaction speeds. The variation in interference competition was as large across populations of Didinium as has been observed previously across species from a variety of taxa including birds, mammals, insects, crustaceans, flatworms and protists. The link between exploitation and interference competition alters our understanding of how interference competition influences population dynamics. Instead of simply stabilizing systems, variation in interference levels can shift population dynamics through qualitatively different regimes because of its association with exploitation competition. Strong interference competition pushes a system to a regime of deterministic extinction, but intermediate interference generates a system that is stable with a high competitive ability. This may help to explain why the distribution of interference values is unimodal and mostly intermediate in intensity. Synthesis Exploitation and interference competition are typically viewed as separate processes. Exploitation is described with a functional response in which the inclusion of interference competition -- the effect of predator density on foraging rates -- is optional. Although recent work indicates that interference competition is widespread, there is little work linking the two forms of competition. In this article we present evidence that exploitation and interference competition are linked mechanistically through movement patterns that simultaneously generate beneficial interactions of consumers with resources and detrimental interactions with other consumers. This connection alters our view of the role that interference plays in ecological dynamics.},

Despite increased complexity, we reduce the theory to a simple null model that we call the genotypic view. This states that cooperation will occur when cells are surrounded by identical genotypes at the loci that drive interactions, with genetic identity coming from recent clonal growth or horizontal gene transfer (HGT). In contrast, because cooperation is only expected to evolve between different genotypes under restrictive ecological conditions, different genotypes will typically compete. Competition between two genotypes includes mutual harm but, importantly, also many interactions that are beneficial to one of the two genotypes, such as predation. The literature offers support for the genotypic view with relatively few examples of cooperation between genotypes. However, the study of microbial interactions is still at an early stage. We outline the logic and methods that help to better evaluate our perspective and move us toward rationally engineering microbial communities to our own advantage. },

@article{Cornforth13a,
	Abstract = {The field of ecology has long recognized two types of competition: exploitative competition, which occurs indirectly through resource consumption, and interference competition, whereby one individual directly harms another. Here, we argue that these two forms of competition have played a dominant role in the evolution of bacterial regulatory networks. In particular, we argue that several of the major bacterial stress responses detect ecological competition by sensing nutrient limitation (exploitative competition) or direct cell damage (interference competition). We call this competition sensing: a physiological response that detects harm caused by other cells and that evolved, at least in part, for that purpose. A key prediction of our hypothesis is that bacteria will counter-attack when they sense ecological competition but not when they sense abiotic stress. In support of this hypothesis, we show that bacteriocins and antibiotics are frequently upregulated by stress responses to nutrient limitation and cell damage but very rarely upregulated by stress responses to heat or osmotic stress, which typically are not competition related. We argue that stress responses, in combination with the various mechanisms that sense secretions, enable bacteria to infer the presence of ecological competition and navigate the 'microbe-kill-microbe' world in which they live.},

The interfering species realizes a "profit" if some resources, which the species interfered against would have utilized, are made available as a result of the interference. Interference is favored when its cost is small, its effect is high, and the resource overlap with the species interfered against is high. Interference is likely to be an alternative strategy to high exploitation efficiency. The incorporation of interference into niche theory clarifies the competitive phenomenon of unstable equilibrium points, excess density compensation on islands, competitive avoidance by escape in time and space, the persistence of the "prudent predator," and the magnitude of the difference between the size of a species' fundamental niche and its realized niche.},

Considering scales of interaction beyond the level of the individual host could lead to new insights. Metacommunity theory has many of the tools necessary for modeling multiscale processes and has been successfully applied to host microbiomes. However, the biotic nature of the host requires an expansion of theory to incorporate feedback between the habitat patch (host) and their local (microbial) community. This feedback can have unexpected effects, is predicted to be common, and can arise through a variety of mechanisms, including developmental, ecological, and evolutionary processes. We propose a new way forward for both metacommunity theory and host microbiome research that incorporates this feedback.},

	Abstract = {Microbial cells secrete numerous enzymes, scavenging molecules, and signals that can promote the growth and survival of other cells around them [1-4]. This observation is consistent with the evolution of cooperation within species [5], and there is now an increasing emphasis on the importance of cooperation between different microbial species [4, 6]. We lack, however, a systematic test of the importance of mutually positive interactions between different species, which is vital for assessing the commonness and importance of cooperative evolution in natural communities. Here, we study the extent of mutually positive interaction among bacterial strains isolated from a common aquatic environment. Using data collected from two independent experiments evaluating community productivity across diversity gradients, we show that (1) in pairwise species combinations, the great majority of interactions are net negative and (2) there is no evidence that strong higher-order positive effects arise when more than two species are mixed together. Our data do not exclude the possibility of positive effects in one direction where one species gains at the expense of another, i.e., predator-prey-like interactions. However, these do not constitute cooperation and our analysis suggests that the typical result of adaptation to other microbial species will be competitive, rather than cooperative, phenotypes.},

@article{Vallespir-Lowery19a,
	Abstract = {The dynamics and stability of ecological communities are intimately linked with the specific interactions-like cooperation or predation-between constituent species. In microbial communities, like those found in soils or the mammalian gut, physical anisotropies produced by fluid flow and chemical gradients impact community structure and ecological dynamics, even in structurally isotropic environments. Although natural communities existing in physically unstructured environments are rare, the role of environmental structure in determining community dynamics and stability remains poorly studied. To address this gap, we used modified Lotka-Volterra simulations of competitive microbial communities to characterize the effects of surface structure on community dynamics. We find that environmental structure has profound effects on communities, in a manner dependent on the specific pattern of interactions between community members. For two mutually competing species, eventual extinction of one competitor is effectively guaranteed in isotropic environments. However, addition of environmental structure enables long-term coexistence of both species via local "pinning" of competition interfaces, even when one species has a significant competitive advantage. In contrast, while three species competing in an intransitive loop (as in a game of rock-paper-scissors) coexist stably in isotropic environments, structural anisotropy disrupts the spatial patterns on which coexistence depends, causing chaotic population fluctuations and subsequent extinction cascades. These results indicate that the stability of microbial communities strongly depends on the structural environment in which they reside. Therefore, a more complete ecological understanding, including effective manipulation and interventions in natural communities of interest, must account for the physical structure of the environment.},

This stability is considered critical for good health but is poorly understood. Here we develop a body of ecological theory to help us understand microbiome stability. Although cooperating networks of microbes can be efficient, we find that they are often unstable. Counterintuitively, this finding indicates that hosts can benefit from microbial competition when this competition dampens cooperative networks and increases stability. More generally, stability is promoted by limiting positive feedbacks and weakening ecological interactions. We have analyzed host mechanisms for maintaining stability-including immune suppression, spatial structuring, and feeding of community members-and support our key predictions with recent data. },

	Abstract = {The mammalian gut harbors a vast community of microorganisms - termed the microbiota - whose composition and dynamics are considered to be critical drivers of host health. These factors depend, in part, upon the manner in which microbes interact with one another. Microbes are known to engage in a myriad of different ways, ranging from unprovoked aggression to actively feeding each other. However, the relative extent to which these different interactions occur between microbes within the gut is unclear. In this minireview we assess our current knowledge of microbe-microbe interactions within the mammalian gut microbiota, and the array of methods used to uncover them. In particular, we highlight the discrepancies between different methodologies: some studies have revealed rich networks of cross-feeding interactions between microbes, whereas others suggest that microbes are more typically locked in conflict and actively cooperate only rarely. We argue that to reconcile these contradictions we must recognize that interactions between members of the microbiota can vary across condition, space, and time - and that only through embracing this dynamism will we be able to comprehensively understand the ecology of our gut communities.},

	Abstract = {The ecological forces that govern the assembly and stability of the human gut microbiota remain unresolved. We developed a generalizable model-guided framework to predict higher-dimensional consortia from time-resolved measurements of lower-order assemblages. This method was employed to decipher microbial interactions in a diverse human gut microbiome synthetic community. We show that pairwise interactions are major drivers of multi-species community dynamics, as opposed to higher-order interactions. The inferred ecological network exhibits a high proportion of negative and frequent positive interactions. Ecological drivers and responsive recipient species were discovered in the network. Our model demonstrated that a prevalent positive and negative interaction topology enables robust coexistence by implementing a negative feedback loop that balances disparities in monospecies fitness levels. We show that negative interactions could generate history-dependent responses of initial species proportions that frequently do not originate from bistability. Measurements of extracellular metabolites illuminated the metabolic capabilities of monospecies and potential molecular basis of microbial interactions. In sum, these methods defined the ecological roles of major human-associated intestinal species and illuminated design principles of microbial communities.},

@article{Gutierrez19a,
	Abstract = {The gut microbiome is a complex microbial community that plays a key role in human health. Diet is an important factor dictating gut microbiome composition. This is mediated by multiple microbe-microbe interactions that result in the fermentation of nondigestible carbohydrates and the production of short-chain fatty acids. Certain species play key metabolic roles in the microbiome, and their disappearance could result in dysbiosis. In this work, a synthetic consortium of 14 gut microbes was studied during the utilization of prebiotic inulin in batch bioreactors. Fermentations were repeated leaving one species out every time, in order to evaluate the impact of their elimination on the system. Substrate consumption, microbial composition, and metabolite production were determined. Single deletions never resulted in a complete loss of bacterial growth or inulin consumption, suggesting functional redundancy. Deletions of Bacteroides dorei and Lachnoclostridium clostridioforme resulted in lower biomass and higher residual inulin. The absence of B. dorei impacted the abundance of the other 10 species negatively. Lachnoclostridium symbiosum, a butyrate producer, appeared to be the most sensitive species to deletions, being stimulated by the presence of Escherichia coli, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. dorei, and Lactobacillus plantarum Conversely, bioreactors without these species did not show butyrate production. L. clostridioforme was observed to be essential for propionate production, and B. dorei for lactate production. Our analysis identified specific members that were essential for the function of the consortium. In conclusion, species deletions from microbial consortia could be a useful approach to identify relevant interactions between microorganisms and defining metabolic roles in the gut microbiome.IMPORTANCE Gut microbes associate, compete for, and specialize in specific metabolic tasks. These interactions are dictated by the cross-feeding of degradation or fermentation products. However, the individual contribution of microbes to the function of the gut microbiome is difficult to evaluate. It is essential to understand the complexity of microbial interactions and how the presence or absence of specific microorganisms affects the stability and functioning of the gut microbiome. The experimental approach of this study could be used for identifying keystone species, in addition to redundant functions and conditions that contribute to community stability. Redundancy is an important feature of the microbiome, and its reduction could be useful for the design of microbial consortia with desired metabolic properties enhancing the tasks of the keystone species.},
