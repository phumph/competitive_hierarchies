## Overview

This file contains explanations for the analysis and logs a list of to-do items for moving through this entire project. My main goal is to submit to *BioRxiv* by April 10.

### To-Do list

#### analysis

- [x] compute trait dispersions from pca
- [ ] analyze pairwise outcome distributions
  - [ ] plot correlates of within-clade dominance
- [ ] re-plot correlations among traits with actual data points (pairs plot)
- [ ] verify accuracy of trio analysis and reproduce plots

#### writing

- [ ] read through Noah's initial edits
- [ ] revise results to include only salient elements of flow
- [ ] cut discussion by â‰¥ 1/3
- [ ] add citations to `.bib` for full draft production
